A lower value is a higher quality, and a subjectively sensible range is 18–28. Consider 18 to be visually lossless or nearly so: it should look the same or nearly the same as the input, but it is not technically lossless. The range is exponential, so increasing the CRF value +6 approximately halves the bitrate, while -6 approximately doubles the bitrate. The general use is to choose the highest CRF value that still provides an acceptable quality. If the output looks good, try a higher value, and if it looks bad, choose a lower value."
